# How it works

This is a local run only. Pretty basic:

- Pull down the code. Open the index.html.
- You'll just see a basic "Choose file". Upload your image
- Once it's uploaded, click on the screen wherever you want to place your lasers. (Right now it's only outfitted for two, but hit me up if you want more)

If you don't place it right, just keep trying over and over as much as you want. Just a heads up, it toggles with each click which laser you're placing.

That's it. Once you have it, do a screenrecording (Command + Shift + 5 on a Mac) for literally just a few seconds to get the GIF.

Find one the million MOV -> GIF converters online and there you go.
