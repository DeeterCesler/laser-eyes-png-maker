# How it works

This is a local run only. Pretty basic, but you'll need node to spin up a simple server.

# install (it requires nodejs/npm)
npm install http-server -g

#run
http-server -p 3001 --cors

Then open up me.html, upload the photo, click on the photo where you want your two lasers (just two). You can keep clicking it until you get it right.

Then hit the "take screenshot" button and it'll download.
